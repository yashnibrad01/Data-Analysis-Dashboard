# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
Sales Performance Dashboard
This was my first data analysis project, and my goal was to take a messy, raw dataset and turn it into a clean, interactive dashboard.
Here's the process I followed:
Data Cleaning: The original data was pretty rough. I used Excel functions like TRIM (to remove extra spaces), TEXT TO COLUMN (to split data), and PROPER (to fix capitalization) to make it standardized and ready for analysis.
Analysis with Pivot Tables: After cleaning, I created four key pivot tables to find insights:
Top 5 Sales Executives by Total Sales
Bottom 5 Sales Executives by Total Sales
Sales Executive Target Hit %
Sales Executive % Away from Target
Visualization: I built the dashboard by linking charts to these pivot tables:
A Clustered Bar Chart to clearly show off the top 5 performers.
A 3-D Pie Chart to visualize what percentage of their targets executives were hitting.
A Line with Markers chart to track how far executives were from achieving their goals.
Interactivity: To make the dashboard truly useful, I added a slicer for all the sales regions (Nagpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Pune, Ranchi, and Surat). Clicking any region instantly filters all the charts, which I think is pretty cool.
I'm really proud of how this turned out as a first project, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
